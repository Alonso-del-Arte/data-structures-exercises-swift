#  Data Structures Exercises

Swift already comes with most if not all of the common data structures ready for 
use. It is nevertheless a worthwhile exercise to recreate data structures that 
already exist.

Including, but not limited to:

* Caches
    * Least recently used (LRU)
    * Least frequently used (LFU)
    * Time to live (TTL)
* Lists
    * Array-backed
    * Singly-linked
    * Doubly-linked
* Maps
    * Hashtable-backed
    * Tree-backed
* Queues
    * Simple priority? (e.g., Take-a-Number at the deli counter)
    * Selective (e.g., heart transplant list selects by blood type)
* Sets
    * Hashtable-backed
    * Tree-backed?

To keep the project scope manageable for the alloted time period, I will only 
work on mutable data structures. However, by the time Hacktoberfest rolls 
around, I might expand this to immutable data structures (excluding caches, of 
course).
